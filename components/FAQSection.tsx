                <AccordionContent>
                  We take data security seriously. While we&apos;re early-stage, we
                  securely store data using trusted cloud providers like BigQuery
                  and rely on industry-standard APIs, including Shopify&apos;s, with
                  top-grade security. Plus, we sign NDAs to guarantee your data
                  remains private.

                <AccordionContent>
                  Onboarding is simple: we just need a single 15-minute call to
                  securely connect your data and a signed NDA. After that, we
                  handle the heavy lifting while you focus on growing your store.
