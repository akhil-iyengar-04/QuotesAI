              <AccordionContent>
                We take data security seriously. While we&apos;re early-stage, we
                securely store data using trusted cloud providers
                and rely on industry-standard APIs, including Shopify&apos;s, with
                top-grade security. Plus, we sign NDAs to guarantee your data
                remains private.

                Onboarding is simple: we just need a single 15-minute call to
                securely connect your data and a signed NDA. After that, we
                handle the heavy lifting while you focus on growing your store.
